My name is David. I am from Taiwan, or, as I would like to say, Formosa, to pay homage to the Portuguese sailors who named the island as such about five centuries ago.  

I chose Management Information Systems as my major because of my interest in technology and the constant rise in demand for it in today's world.

ITM 352 brings me a sense of challenge and adventure! It is like the Dark Souls of classes. I hope to learn as much programming as I can to help me in my pursuit of a career in this field.
